        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Finally! A veggie lasagna I like. I added thawed and drained frozen spinach to the ricotta mixture (what is lasagna without spinach?), and I also followed other suggestions and added about 3/4 cup each of finally chopped carrot, broccoli, and zucchini. It was great. This recipe has become my mainstay for veggie lasagna. Thanks!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Ricotta</li>
                <li>Marinara Sauce</li>
                <li>Dry Pasta</li>
                <li>Spinach</li>
                <li>Zucchini</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>
                <li>Onion</li>
                <li>Mushrooms</li>
                <li>Green Bell Pepper</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook lasagna noodles in a large pot of boiling water for 10 minutes, or until al dente. Rinse with cold water, and drain.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a large saucepan. Add mushrooms, green peppers, onion, and garlic; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in pasta sauce and basil; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>While the sauce is simmering, mix together ricotta, 2 cups mozzarella cheese, and eggs in a medium bowl.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
                <li>Spread 1 cup cooked tomato and vegetable sauce into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Lay down 1/2 of the lasagna noodles and layer 1/2 each of the ricotta mix, sauce, and Parmesan cheese on top. Repeat layering again with noodles, ricotta mix, sauce, and Parmesan cheese. Top with remaining 2 cups mozzarella.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, for 40 minutes. Let stand for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
            </ol>

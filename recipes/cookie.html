    <h1>Sugar Cookie Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../recipes/imgs/sugarcookie.jpg" alt="pixel sugar cookie">
        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Whenever you make these cookies for someone, be sure to bring along several copies of the recipe! You will be asked for it, I promise! NOTE: I make icing with confectioners' sugar and milk. I make it fairly thin, as I 'paint' the icing on the cookies with a pastry brush. Thin enough to spread easily but not so thin that it just makes your cookies wet and runs off.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Sugar</li>
                <li>Eggs</li>
                <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
                <li>Flour</li>
                <li>Baking powder</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Cream together butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Beat in eggs and vanilla. Stir in flour, baking powder, and salt. Cover, and chill dough for at least 1 hour (or overnight).</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Lightly dust a work surface with flour. Roll out dough to 1/4 to 1/2 inch thickness. Cut into shapes with any cookie cutter. Place cookies 1 inch apart on ungreased baking sheets.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Carefully transfer cookies to a wire rack and cool completely before decorating.</li>
            </ol>
